SECOND MINI-PROJECT


##Goal


Download the zipped file UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip from the LMS. Unzip the file and create a directory 'specdata'
in your local file. DO NOT make any modifications in the files included in the zipped file. The data set is about
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. The data includes were collected from the accelerometers from the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Full description of the dataset from

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.



The aim of the project is to clean and extract usable data from the above zip file. R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject.
